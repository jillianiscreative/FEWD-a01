Hello, my name is Jillian McCarthy! I live by the bay in Crown Point, San Diego with my boyfriend of 11 years and my miniature dachshund, Hazel. I am a Southern California native that was born & raised in Los Angeles but relocated to San Diego when I was 17. I love San Diego and am proud to call this place my home!

Things I enjoy:
#Cooking/baking (Bread and bagels are my favorite!)
#Ocean Swimming
#Spending time with my weenie <3
#Horror Movies
#Coffee 

I wear many hats that all tend to revolve around creativity:
#Graphic Design
#Web Design
#Haircolor Specialist

I am currently a Hairstylist that is working on transitioning my career in to digital design. I also dream of opening my own themed coffee shop one day where I can display my artwork, brew amazing coffee and serve delicious treats. If you are interested, check out my [Hairstylist Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jillianiscreative/) to see some of my work!
